# Student Portal Web (Vite + React + Tailwind) — Demo Conversion

This repo is an initial automated conversion of your SwiftUI StudentProfileView and StudentSettingsView into a deployable React app.

How to run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` (for local dev)
3. `npm run build` (build for production — output in `dist/`)

Netlify:
- You can drag the `dist/` folder to Netlify or connect this repo. Netlify build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `dist`.

Notes:
- This is an approximate conversion of the UI (gradients, structure, and text). I preserved structure and UI intent from your SwiftUI.
- I used two Swift files you uploaded to convert: StudentProfileView.swift and StudentSettingsView.swift. The rest of the uploaded Swift files are added as placeholders; send the rest and I will convert them one-by-one into React components that preserve every UI detail.

Files used from uploads: StudentProfileView.swift and StudentSettingsView.swift. See citations in the chat message.
